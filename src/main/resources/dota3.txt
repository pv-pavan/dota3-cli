DOTA 3 is a role playing game (inspired from dota2).

Game begins when you choose a hero of your choice from a pool of heroes available. Once chosen, a game map is generated
with a lot of checkpoints randomly created with a resident hero. Hero has abilities like health, attach damage range,
armour, experience gained per attack.

Player can explore the map, and collect inventory items until deciding to fight. Player has to fight and win a resident
hero at checkpoints sequentially. If the player dies, the game is lost. Player gains experience and levels up as and
when he fights.

You can create multiple profiles and each profile can have many games. You can save and resume a game/profile character
as and when required.

Note:
Leveling up and gained experience does not have any effect.
There is no limit on the inventory, hence the player can always win if he keeps exploring well before fighting.
Bonus life/armour gained using inventory is permanently added to the player.
